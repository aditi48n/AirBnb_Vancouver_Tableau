# Tableau Dashboard- Vancouver AirBnb Insights

This repository contains details about AirBnbs spread across the different neighbourhoods of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The visualizations summarize the average price per day of room types (entire house, hotel, private and shared rooms) and the reviews obtained for each room type. In addition, the average prices across different years from 2008 to 2023 are sumarized. 

Two filtering options- Year and Neighbourhood are also available to further customize the plots and gain a better understanding.
